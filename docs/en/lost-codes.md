Most of the time, losing your secrets doesn't mean you will lose your account forever. Here are a few steps to take to get your accounts back:
- Websites usually give a recovery code to you when you enable 2FA on your account. Use your recovery code to get access to your account.
- If you don't have a recovery code go to the site's support and ask them to disable two factor authentication on your account for you. Recovering your account this way can take a while to process and you will likely need to provide proof of identity.

To prevent from losing codes in the future remember to make a backup every time you add a code.
